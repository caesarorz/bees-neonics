# Bees and Neonics insecticide Analysis

## Description

The following contains an analysis for [Honeybees and Neonic Pesticides](https://www.kaggle.com/kevinzmith/honey-with-neonic-pesticide) dataset.

For analysis (plots, dicussion) check out the jupyter notebook in this repository or my Kaggle notebook: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/cesarorz/honey-bees-and-neonicotinoid-insecticides) or my website with interactive plots: https://caesarorz.github.io/bees-neonics/static_site/index.html.

I found out that we need more interactivity with presenting the information, so I created a website with different plots for States, Pesticides, US Regions and more.

For a better scientific perspective, the following dataset will be analized in the near future:
